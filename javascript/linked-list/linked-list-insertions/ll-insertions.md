# Linked List Insertions

## Feature Tasks

**Challenge Type: Extending an implementation**

Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

**append**
arguments: new value
adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

**insert before**
arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified

**insert after**
arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified

### Unit Tests

Write tests to prove the following functionality:

- Can successfully add a node to the end of the linked list

- Can successfully add multiple nodes to the end of a linked list

- Can successfully insert a node before a node located i the middle of a linked list

- Can successfully insert a node before the first node of a linked list

- Can successfully insert after a node in the middle of the linked list

- Can successfully insert a node after the last node of the linked list
