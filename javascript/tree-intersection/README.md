# Tree Intersection

Challenge: Find common values in 2 binary trees.

Problem Domain:

- Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary trees as parameters.

- Using your Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Structure and Testing

- Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

- Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

- Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
